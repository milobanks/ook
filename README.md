# Object Oriented Kernel

Ook is an experimental, object-oriented operating system kernel designed to
explore a resource management model where everything is an object. Unlike
traditional UNIX-like systems that expose resources as files, Ook introduces
a structured object system inspired by Windows's Object Manager and component
models like COM and CORBA.

This is not intended to be a fully-featured production OSâ€”rather, it's a
proof-of-concept aimed at exploring new approaches to IPC, resource management,
and modular system design. The kernel doesn't even have a userspace, and likely
won't have one.
